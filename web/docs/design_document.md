The Angular application is structured into the following main components:

- AppComponent: Root component
- TournamentComponent: Displays list of tournaments
- SingleTournamentComponent: Shows details of a specific tournament
- TeamComponent: Manages teams
- TeamDetailsComponent: Displays team details and players
- PlayerComponent: Manages players
- PlayerMatchesComponent: Shows match history for a player
- TeamMatchComponent: Displays and manages team matches
- TeamStandingsComponent: Shows tournament standings
- LoginComponent: Handles user authentication

    }
  ]

## 7. API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API for all data operations. Key API endpoints include:

- GET /api/tournament: Fetch all tournaments
- GET /api/tournament/{id}: Fetch single tournament details
- GET /api/tournament/{id}/team: Fetch teams for a tournament
- GET /api/tournament/{id}/standing: Fetch tournament standings
- GET /api/team/{id}: Fetch team details
- GET /api/team/{id}/player: Fetch players for a team
- POST /api/player: Add a new player
- DELETE /api/player/{id}: Delete a player
- POST /api/team_match: Create a new team match
- GET /api/team_match/{id}: Fetch team match details
- POST /api/match: Create a new single match
- DELETE /api/match/{id}: Delete a single match
- GET /api/player/{id}/matches: Fetch player match history

## 8. Security Considerations

- Use JWT for authentication
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admin actions
- Secure API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access

## 9. Future Enhancements

- Implement real-time updates for match scores
- Add tournament creation and management features
- Integrate with external badminton ranking systems
- Implement a mobile app version

## 10. Conclusion
